# Drum-Key

Drum-Key is a simple drum beat simulator, that produces beats on key strokes. For now, we have 9 beats, each associated with a keyboard key stroke.

## Installation

This is a stand alone code built completely using HTML, CSS, and pure **vanilla JavaScript**.

Check out the live demo of Drum-Kit [here](https://63b5e2e967cd3146b89ce347--visionary-marshmallow-a1c3a3.netlify.app/)

## Learning

I learnt how much we could implement and execute with simple vanilla JavaScript. This would help in the future to write leaner yet efficient code using large frameworks like React.js or Vue.js

Specially learnt and revised concepts in:

- Adding Event Listeners
- CSS Styling and Animations
  - Grid Layout
  - Glow Effects
  - Smooth Transitions
- Dynamic CSS styling
- Working with Audio Files in JavaScript
